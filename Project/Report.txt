Introduction
It can be tough to know what we would like to listen when faced with an archive of thousand of musics. For our project we wondered how we could generate a list of songs that would correspond to one's taste. We will explore the features of the Free Music Archive (FMA) to generate a graph that will contain many songs of selected genres. These songs can then be sorted and we can then generate playlists out of a "bubble" of this graph.

1. Generating the graph
During previous work we found out that simply using the cosine distance between the nodes of our graph wasn't the best idea as we couldn't figure out a way to separate even only two genres. Fot this project we first normalized all the features to a same weight. By then using a spring layout (force-based), we can easily distinguish between Rock, Hip-hop, and Folk 
*PICTURE :D cosine graph vs eulidian*

2. Generating a playlist
To generate a playlist we are then going to select songs around the selected song (node) in the graph. This selection can be made either from the nearest neighbours, or from a generated heat distribution around this node. When listening to a playlist, it is nice to be able to tell how adventurous we feel regarding the inclusion of other styles. This can be assimilated to the "radius" of the "bubble" of neighbouring songs.

3. Including our own songs
Finally we want to be able to propose, out of a selected personnal song, an alternative playlist, made of free music. One could then extract music that should correspond to its taste, for free. By using the given function to extract features of any song, we can then place our song in the free music graph. We can then proceed as previously to generate a new playlist. By doing so, we can also tell the user which type of music corresponds to the selected song.

Conclusion
By using what we learned during the course and the project milestones, we were able to gain and use some knowledge on graphs and Python to generate awesome playlists, and we hope these will inspire generation of free music listeners. :P
